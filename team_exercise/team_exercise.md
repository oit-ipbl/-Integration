# Team exercise

[README](../README.md)

---

## Objectives

Integrate image processing and robotics techniques and develop one or more mini-games which includes both of the technologies.  
The mini-games can be used as a subset of the final competition.

Additionaly, all teams have to submit a slide to explain the mini-game.

## Prerequisite

You have to finish all of [robots](https://github.com/oit-ipbl/robots) and [image processing](https://github.com/oit-ipbl/image_processing).

**Team members coorporation is the most essential factor.**

## Exercise (team development 1)

Implement one or more mini-games, which include windows side image processing technology and ROS side robotics technology.

**You must complete this with team members!**

Break down the task into some pieces, and assign them to all members.

### Mini-game ideas

If you and your team members have no ideas, the following list may help you.

- 壁の色を見て何かをする課題について，色を識別してその色をロボットに見せるようなIntegration題材にする
- Calculation problem
  - Calculate the displayed formula (for example, the addition formula of two-digit numbers) and answer the calculation result with your finger.
  - Create a calculation problem using ```random``` (see [Challenge [Hands2]](https://github.com/oit-ipbl/image_processing/blob/main/advanced/holistic.md#challengehands2)).
- Staring Contest
  - If you don't laugh for 5 seconds after seeing the image presented by the robot, the human will win.
  - For example, you can use facial landmarks to determine if you laughed.
- ロボットが示す手を両手で出す
- Follow Me.
  - Move the object on the stage simulator, and control the robot to follow it.
  - User can send start signal of follow me with hand gesture that can be recognized by Windows side program using media-pipe.
  - cf. [This movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-CcklPzvyo) shows an example follow me robot. It's not a simulation but real robots.

They are just ideas, and we can not ensure possibility of them.  
Use the list as a hint for the exercise and let's discuss with your team members.

**Make interesting games!**

## Exercise (team development 2)

Make a presentation slide which explains your games.

- Team name and member list.
- Overview of your games.
- Screen shots.
- Algorithms.
- Team members' roles.
  - Leader.
  - Algorithm desiginer.
  - Programmer (image, ROS etc.)
  - Slide designer.
  - Article writer.
  - Supporter.
  - ...

### Slide submission

- The slide submission URL will open after Aug. 9.
- The URL and submission method will be published at SLACK #general channel.
- You have to submit the slide until Aug. 20.
