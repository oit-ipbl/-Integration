# Team exercise

[README](../README.md)

---

## Objectives
- We have two exercises for each team.
1. Creating youtube videos for cross-cultural communication
2. Integrate image processing and robotics techniques and develop a game which includes both of the technologies for the final competition.

## Prerequisite
- All members of your team have to finish all pre-learning assignments.
  - [robots](https://github.com/oit-ipbl/robots)
  - [image processing](https://github.com/oit-ipbl/image_processing) 
  - [integration ](https://github.com/oit-ipbl/Integration)

## Deadline and product submission
- Exercise1 (Cross-cultural communication through foond introduction)
  - Your team has to create youtube videos until 8/17
- Exercise2 (Develop a game using image processing and robotics techniques)
  - The final competition will be held at 9/4.
  - We will show the detailed rules for the final competition at 8/18 on slack and github.

## Exercise1 (Cross-cultural communication and creating youtube video)
- Let's create a video to cook and introduce the foods in each other's country and publish it on youtube.
- The rules are as follows.
  - English only (exclude name of foods)
  - Your team need to introduce at least one Japanese and Thai food in your video.
  - **OIT** students should cook and introduce **Thai food** and **SIIT** students should cook and introduce **Japanese food**.
  - Please consult with each other carefully before deciding which dish to introduce.
  - You need to create and publish at least one video.
    - Upload your video as "Unlisted" or "Public" (in Japanese, "限定公開" or "公開") to youtube.
  - All the students should appear in the video. (If it is difficult, only voice appearance is acceptable)
  - Please take care of the copyrights.
  - Time length is not limited, but 5 minutes or less is desirable.
  - We plan to release all team videos somewhere between August 18-26.
- Please watch the videos of the other teams with team members, and vote through team discussion for the top three videos that make you want to try the food introduced. (i.e. Each team has three voting points)

## Exercise2 (Creating a game for the final competition)
- For the final competition, you are going to develop a program that combines robotics and image processing such as pre-learning assignments(Integration). Please develop a more sophisticated story-based program in which robots and person interact, like dungeon exploring etc.. We hope that you will be able to program an attractive and fun robot-human interaction!
- The detailed specifications are opened at 8/18.
