# Integration

- You have to do all the following `Pre-learning Assignments`.
  - We strongly recommend all students read the documents on all exercises because there would be many hints or important information helping you done the final development for iPBL.
- The following sample programs will help you develop more advanced communication programs between windows side and ros side. Work with your team members to try out the samples.

## Pre-learning Assignments
  - [Message exchange between a python program running on Windows and a ROS node running on ubuntu](win_single/win_single.md)
  - [Message exchange between a ROS node and multi Windows programs](win_multi/win_multi.md)

## Sample Programs
  - [Rock-paper-scissors game](samples/rps.md)

> **Note**
- You may see the warning like this while executing the programs in this texts, but it's no probrem.

```shell
[WARN] [1626227423.468573, 2825.100000]: Inbound TCP/IP connection failed: connection from sender terminated before handshake header received. 0 bytes were received. Please check sender for additional details.
```

- We provide wrapper classes to simplify the communication process between ROS and Windows. If you feel any inconvenience for our wrappers, modify them freely.
