# Integration

- You have to read all documents.
- You have to do `practice` tasks and `exercise` tasks which are in each section.
- There are some challenge tasks.

We strongly recommend all students read the documents on all challenge tasks because there would be many hints or important information helping you done the final tasks.
Especially you want to work hard about image processing and robotics, please try to complete challenge tasks if possible.
