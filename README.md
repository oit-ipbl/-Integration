# Integration

- You have to read all documents.
- You have to do `practice` tasks and `exercise` tasks which are in each section.
- There are some `challenge` tasks.
  - We strongly recommend all students read the documents on all challenge tasks because there would be many hints or important information helping you done the final tasks.
  - Especially you want to work hard about image processing and robotics, please try to complete challenge tasks if possible.
